# Local-Weather
Free Code Camp Local Weather Project

This was originally created using CodePen per the Free Code Camp challenge. 

Users are to be able to see the current weather conditions for their respective location, as well as view a background image or icon dipicting the current state of the weather.

Users are also supposed to be able to click a button to toggle the temperature reading between fahrenheit and celsius. I originally created a button to do this, however later opted to make the temp reading clickable, and removed the button. A hover action over the temp reading  indicates this by changing the text highlighting, a cursor icon change, and a tooltip indicating the toggle.
